This repository contains the source code for a blog [post](https://www.liam-reilly.info/blog/post/tailwind/).

This post shows how you might build a `<ContactForm>` component and how you might style it using two very different approaches.

The first method is styling using the popular CSS-in-JS library: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

The second method is styling using the popular CSS utility library: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

The project is a complete web app built with the following technologies:

* React
* NextJS
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Styled-Components
